# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took RAIT in OMSCS during Spring 2023.

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in Canvas. Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit any introductory or summary videos, as well the as office hours lessons.

## Textbook Information

The following textbook may be helpful:

- [Probabilistic Robotics (Intelligent Robotics and Autonomous Agents series)](https://amzn.to/3cZIUwo)
