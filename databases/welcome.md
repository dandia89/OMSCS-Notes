# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took Databases in OMSCS during Fall 2022.

Each document in the "Lecture Notes" section to the right corresponds to a lesson in [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/24620/lessons/). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit any intro/summary lessons.

## Textbook Information

The following textbook is required:

- [Fundamentals of Database Systems](https://amzn.to/3QUxZYC)
