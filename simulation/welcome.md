# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes for Simulation, which I took in Fall 2020.

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a module in Canvas. Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that module. Usually, I omit any introductory, summary, or administrative content.

## Textbook Information

The following textbooks helped me get an **A** in this course:

- [Simulation Modeling and Analysis](https://amzn.to/3au4zN5)
- [Simulation with Arena](https://amzn.to/2E4zTWo)

## Download These Notes

Some students have asked for PDF versions of the notes for a simpler, more portable
studying experience. The following PDFs are available for download.

- [Simulation - Exam 1 Cheat Sheet](https://payhip.com/b/Lk14 'A two-page PDF cheat sheet for Simulation Exam 1. The source .tex file is included for easy editing.')
