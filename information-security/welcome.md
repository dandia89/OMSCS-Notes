# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took IIS in OMSCS during Fall 2019.

I have organized them into two sections:

- Lecture Notes
- Exam Review

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud459). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit any intro/summary lessons.

The "Exam Review" section contains student-generated study guides for both the midterm and the final exam,
as well as a complete list of the Udacity quizzes and answers.

## Textbook Information

The following textbook helped me get an **A** in this course:

- [Computer Security: Principles and Practice](https://amzn.to/3d8YPc9)

## Download These Notes

Some students have asked for PDF versions of the notes for a simpler, more portable
studying experience. The following PDFs are available for download.

- [Introduction to Information Security - Complete](https://payhip.com/b/51wH 'The complete set of IIS notes, including lecture notes and exam review materials.')
